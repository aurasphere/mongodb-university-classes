# Problem 
This problem is provided as a supplementary learning opportunity. It is more challenging that the ordinary homework. It is ungraded. We do not ask you submit an answer.

Write an update command that will remove the "tomato.consensus" field for all documents matching the following criteria:

 - The number of imdb votes is less than 10,000
 - The year for the movie is between 2010 and 2013 inclusive
 - The tomato.consensus field is null

How many documents required an update to eliminate a "tomato.consensus" field?

NOTE: There is a dump of the video database included in the handouts for the "Creating Documents" lesson. Use that data set to answer this question.

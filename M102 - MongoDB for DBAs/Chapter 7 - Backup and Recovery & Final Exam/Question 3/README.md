# Problem
In question 2 the mongod on port 27003 does a rollback. Go to that mongod's data directory. Look for a rollback directory inside. Find the .bson file there. Run the bsondump utility on that file. What are its contents?

Choose the best answer:

 - There is no such file.
 - It contains 2 documents.
 - It contains 3 documents.
 - It contains 4 documents.
 - It contains 8 documents.
 - The file exists but is 0 bytes long.

# Problem
You would like to create a replica set that is robust to data center failure.

You only have two data centers available. Which arrangement(s) of servers will allow you to be stay up (as in, still able to elect a primary) in the event of a failure of either data center (but not both at once)? Check all that apply.

Check all that apply:

 - All 3 servers in data center 1.
 - 2 servers in data center 1, one server in data center 2.
 - None of the above.
